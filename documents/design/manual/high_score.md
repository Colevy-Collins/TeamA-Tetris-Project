# Highscore - User Manual

## Introduction 

The Highscore feature keeps track of your best score in the Tetris game. It saves your highest score on your computer, so you can see it the next time you play the game to track your progress and competitiveness.

## Viewing Highscore

1. Start the Tetris game.
2. Your high score is displayed on the game's interface under the label "High Score."
3. This score is fetched from your local storage, showing the highest score obtained in past gaming sessions on the same computer.

## Updating Highscore

- Your current score is continually updated during gameplay in the "Score" display. 
- If your current score surpasses the displayed high score, the high score will automatically update to this new value. 
- The new high score will be saved locally at the conclusion of the game or upon obtaining the score, ensuring it persists for future sessions.

## Troubleshooting Highscore

- If your high score is not displayed or not updating, please check that your game has permissions to read and write to local storage.
- Ensure that no other processes are interrupting the game's ability to save the high score.
- If problems persist, contact support for further assistance.
