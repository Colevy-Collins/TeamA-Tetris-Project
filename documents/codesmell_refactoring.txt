Code smell: SRP Violation
    - In TetrisStartMenu, TetrisPauseMenu and TetrisEndMenu the initialize functions were violating the SRP principle by calling the function components of the UI as well as customly creating the the background and then applying it. 
Refactor: Extract Method
    - To fix this SRP violation, a drawBackground function was created to minimize responsiblities of the intialize function.
